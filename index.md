# Marathon Times: An Exploratory Analysis

## Executive Summary

## Motivation
Our project sought to analyze the progression of marathon race times of elite racers through recent history by observing the development of the world’s most elite marathons – the World Marathon Majors and the Olympic marathon race. We wanted to find out how marathon times have changed through history and what factors may be contributing to these changes. This was a topic of interest for further study because as the world becomes more technologically advanced and complex, running is one of the few things that remains one of the most fundamental and basic activities in our world. This is not to say humans have not found ways to improve upon the sport – through its long history since the first ever organized marathon at the 1896 Athens Olympics to present day worldwide road races, runners have continued to set and break records, pushing the limits of our physical abilities, and continue to strive for groundbreaking race times, with an official sub 2-hour marathon record waiting to be reached. How exactly have marathon times progressed throughout history and what patterns can we deduce to help us understand where marathon times are headed? This is the question that drove us to research this topic. 

## Justification
In the midst of a world experiencing political instability, economic growth, and public health crises, running may seem like a minor subject of little relevance. However, it is a sport that brings the world together, foregoes our differences, and lets the most basic abilities of humans and their perseverance speak for themselves. All around the world from New York to Berlin to London, runners join together for one of the longest and most popular road races. It’s a sport that anyone of all skill levels can start and it is a race that any runner can train for. The democratic nature of running therefore provides relevance of this study to all – how have humans capitalized on our running capabilities and what does the future of running look like? For elite runners, our research can provide a greater clarity of what past marathon time progression means for the future of marathon racing. Even for amateur runners, patterns found in our data can provide a better guideline of how they might expect their marathon times to progress, vary, or differ from others. Can we deduce how factors like gender, age, or even temperature affect each person’s abilities to run? Though our analysis is focused on marathons, we hope our findings will inform runners of all abilities and contribute to an ever-growing knowledge of the sport. 

## Aim
The aim of our project was an exploratory analysis to find factors that can influence race times. We wanted to find trends in the race time data across multiple venues to give us a large amount of data points and a wide array of influential factors. Once we finished the analysis we wanted to see if race times can be determined by factors outside of the runners. Thus, letting us see if specific races or runners will always perform better due to certain factors.
